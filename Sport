Yes there are a few public swimming pools. Thre is the man inndoor one at a bigg sports complex in the cenr of town. Ther are also a couple of outdoor ones , but you can only use them in summer as it is be too could in winter. One is a big one in a park, the other is a much smaller one.
7. Do you think  every one should blearn to swim?
Of course, I think it's very important. Firstly, you spend much of your life on holiday by water, for example, when you go to the beach on holidya, so you won't be able to enjoy yourself with your  freinds if you cna't swim. Also, for safety reasons it's very important. You often hear about sad accidents imvoving young chdren so it's very imprtant.
