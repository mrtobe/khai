No, clothes and fashions are not really important to me. I tend to wear clothes that are comfortable and pratical rather than fashionalbe.

t follow fashin. I think I have dressed in a similar way  for the last 10 years.
Do you think the clothes we wear say something about who we aer?
Yes, they probably do. Some people are really carefull about what they wear because  tehy want to be seen as stylish. Other people wear closthes taht show wealth or status, such as cloes by famous designers.

Uniform
1. Have you ever worn uniform
Yes. I used to wear a uniform when I was in my school.
2,Do you think uniform is imprtant?
Yes I stronglly belive that uniform is very improtant. Uniform gives us discipline. I used to lvie my shcool uniform becuase it showed us that we  were together. Uniform also shows unity. Moreover it is not possible for every one in the school to buy expensive clothes, so uniform eradicates the problem of inequality.
